# FaceNet based Attendance System
> A **Deep Learning** based Web Application for marking attendance of students by recognizing the student's faces from the surveillance video footage of classroom.

## Getting Started
A Web Application in Python for recognizing student's faces in a classroom from the surveillance video and marking the attendance in an Excel Sheet. Deep learning algorithms like **MTCNN** and **FaceNet** are used for **face detection** and **recognition** respectively. And using the **Flask framework**, the Web App was created.

## Algorithms Used
- MTCNN (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Neural Networks)
- FaceNet

## Prerequisites
The following things needs to be installed properly in your machine.
- Tensorflow
- Python 
- Flask
- scipy
- opencv
- h5py
- matplotlib
- Pillow
- requests
- psutil
